## 🧭 Usage

This landing page is designed to guide visitors through the available quantum computing courses.

### 🖥️ How to Use

- Open in a browser via `http://localhost:3000` or your hosted domain.
- Navigate the page using menu links or scroll interactions.
- Just Make front-end and learning/testing GEMINI 🐱

### 🌐 Hosting the Page

You can host the landing page on any static hosting service like:

- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify

## 🔧 Gemini CLI Details

This project was **generated using the Gemini CLI** as part of an experiment in terminal-based UI generation.

### 🛠️ How Gemini CLI Was Used

The following command was used to scaffold the project:

```bash
gemini generate landing-page --theme modern --data quantum_courses_data.json
```

### ⚠️ Observations from the Gemini CLI Workflow

- ✅ Quick generation of page structure and assets.
- 🔄 Required post-generation tweaking for layout precision.
- 🎨 Styling was somewhat rigid — fine-tuning was manual.
- 📄 JSON-based data input was intuitive but lacked advanced templating support.
- ❗ Limited error handling when passing incomplete data files.

Gemini CLI proved helpful for initial scaffolding but required manual enhancement for polish and performance.
